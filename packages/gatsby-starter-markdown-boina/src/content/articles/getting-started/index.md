# Getting Started

At weKnow we have been using Gatsby with Drupal for projects as our decouple strategy lately, and after building a few sites with Drupal and Gatsby we found some challenges, which we resolved writing custom code. But now weâ€™ve decided to share and contribute our knowledge releasing the following projects.

### Markdown

* Toast UI Editor (module)
* Build Hooks (module)
* Markdown Boina (distribution + installation profile)

### Gatsby

* gatsby-remark-twitter (plugin)
* gatsby-remark-codepen (plugin)
* gatsby-remark-twitch (plugin)
* gatsby-starter-markdown-boina (starter)
* gatsby-theme-markdown-boina (theme)
